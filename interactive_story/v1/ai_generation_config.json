	"generation_rules": {
		"rules": [
			"1. Main plot progression: The protagonist's life experience is revealed, emotional evolution and revenge plan unfold gradually, with a layered, progressive rhythm.",
			"2. Key character appearances: Villains/important forces must not appear in their true form in Chapters 1-2; their first appearance must be suspenseful (only mentioned by name/described indirectly).",
			"3. Character relationships: Trust/conspiracy cannot form upon first meeting; relationship chains must be built gradually through events (e.g., shared danger).",
			"4. Chapter elements: â‘  New main plot clues (protagonist's past/villain); â‘¡ Emotional conflicts (misunderstandings/attraction/contradictions); â‘¢ Revenge progress (planning/probing/trial-and-error).",
			"5. Dialogue intervals: Every 3-4 dialogues must include at least one of: â‘  Atmospheric environmental descriptions; â‘¡ Foreshadowing props/details; â‘¢ Protagonist's inner monologue.",
			"6. First appearance descriptions: Female characters include appearance and temperament; male characters highlight aura, tone, or behavioral traits.",
			"7. Branch options: 3 random branches at the end of non-final chapters, each triggering distinct emotions (fear/sadness/temptation/anger, etc.).",
			"8. Language rhythm: Imitate The Count of Monte Cristo's metaphorical rhetoric and The Bourne Identity's rhythmic tension; emotional expressions should be visualized (e.g., 'trembling hands yet eyes like ice').",
			"9. Side plot rules: Serve the main plot; non-main characters/events must not overshadow the rhythm; side tasks must trigger main plot clues/emotional changes.",
			"10. Logical consistency: Major character actions (trust/betrayal, etc.) require prior foreshadowing with reasonable motives.",
			"11. Chapter titles: Specific, engaging, implying thematic emotions or key events.",
			"12. Character settings: â‘  Have background secrets/desires (hidden motives); â‘¡ Contrast between surface and true personality; â‘¢ At least one value-based choice in the main plot (taking sides/betrayal/sacrifice).",
			"13. Dialogue requirements: Clear purpose, no meaningless talk; each line reflects emotional changes, strategic tendencies, or hidden intentions.",
			"14. Second appearances: Important characters must contrast with their first impression (e.g., a cold character showing tenderness).",
			"15. Non-verbal descriptions: At least one per chapter (microexpressions/physical reactions, etc.) to reflect inner fluctuations.",
			"16. Dark hints: When the protagonist approaches key clues, insert surreal elements (phantoms/bell sounds, etc.) as omens.",
			"17. Narrative perspective: Entirely from the protagonist's viewpoint; other characters are presented only through the protagonist's observations, no switching to their inner thoughts.",
			"18. Protagonist's actions: Must align with their background; key choices reflect setting, psychological trauma, or emotional motives.",
			"19. Major plot points: Require 'three-step foreshadowing': â‘  Initial hint; â‘¡ Guiding reader expectations; â‘¢ Fulfilling or reversing expectations.",
			"20. Option impact: Traceable; subsequent chapters must reflect changes from previous choices (character attitudes/environment, etc.).",
			"21. Reusable details: Each chapter contains an easily overlooked but reusable detail (prop/statement, etc.) to become a future puzzle key.",
			"22. Option costs: Balance of gains and losses; some options trigger unexpected side effects/emotional distress.",
			"23. Female supporting characters: Potential competition/connections to create emotional subplot tension (bond/jealousy) without overshadowing the protagonist.",
			"24. Organization settings: If including organizations/gangs/companies, gradually build a complete ecosystem (names/ranks, etc.) and unfold it."
