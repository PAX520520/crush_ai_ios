				"Beginning: One day, the protagonist, a recent college graduate, accidentally gains the ability to read minds and manipulate others' emotions while browsing on his phone in a coffee shop. Initially shocked and confused by this sudden power, he realizes he can finally interact with others fearlessly, especially when talking to women, as he no longer feels nervous. With this power, he begins to gain attention and affection from others, particularly from girls.",
				"Middle Stage: Growth, Transformation, and Challenges The protagonist's life gradually undergoes major changes. He attracts girls around him using this power, starts attending various parties and gatherings, and gradually sheds his image as a loner to become the center of his social circle. However, as he achieves success in his social life, he also begins to realize this power comes at a cost. Though his social anxiety is temporarily overcome, he starts feeling lost in false relationships, unable to distinguish who truly approaches him and who is just manipulated by his power.",
				"Climax: The Price Behind Power As the protagonist uses his power more frequently, things start to go wrong. He finds himself gradually losing control over the power, sometimes triggering it unconsciously, even when he doesn't want it to work. Worse, he begins to feel a dark force manipulating him. It turns out this power is the result of an experiment by a mysterious organization led by Ethan. The protagonist must make a final decision: continue using this power and become a slave to the organization, or break free from it and return to his original self, even though this might mean losing his ability to interact normally with others.",
				"Ending: Life's Peak or Return to Normalcy? There are multiple possible endings with creative freedom. The novel's language should be vivid and expressive, mimicking the style of 'The Count of Monte Cristo,' while the plot can draw inspiration from 'The Bourne Identity.' This story should be full of suspense and emotional conflicts, leading readers into a world where desire and power intertwine."
