Calian faces a choice: trust Elina and follow her to find the truth; act alone and risk sneaking back to the capital; or stay in town, hiding his identity.",

			"content": "The night was dark as ink, and the border town tavern was filled with the smell of ale and sweat. Dim candlelight danced on wooden tables, illuminating a haggard yet handsome face. Calian Valencia, once a prince, now nothing more than a wanderer in a tattered cloak, sat in the corner, staring emptily at the empty glass in his hand."
		},
		{
			"type": "narrator",
			"content": "The last thing he remembered was the feast in the palace, amidst the clinking of glasses, his uncle Edmund's smile carried a hint of malice. Then came darkness, followed by the sentence of exile. He didn't know why he was charged with treason, nor how he ended up in this desolate town."
